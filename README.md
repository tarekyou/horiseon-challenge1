refracted code by:
1) adding missing links to route to correct section and adding a href to the header to route to homepage when clicked
2) adding alt attribute to images
3) streamlining common properties in stylesheet into one set of properties and adjusting corresponding class in index.html
4) removed unnecessary properties from stylesheet
5) adding comments to index.html to make it easier to point out a certain section
6) changing the page title
